# Library Management System - SQL Project

## Overview
This project focuses on managing and analyzing a library system using SQL. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, CRUD operations, advanced SQL queries, and stored procedures to handle book issuance, returns, and member management. The project also generates reports on branch performance, overdue books, and active members.

## Tasks Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Verified and corrected data types for tables like `issued_status`, `return_status`, and `members`.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Inserted new book records, updated member addresses, and deleted issued records.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed rental income by category, identified overdue books, and generated branch performance reports.
4. **Advanced SQL**: Created stored procedures for book issuance and return management, and used CTAS to generate summary tables.
5. **Reports**: Generated reports on active members, top-performing employees, and overdue book fines.
